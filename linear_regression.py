"""
The Core Idea ðŸ§ The goal of linear regression is to find the "best-fit line" (or plane, for multiple features) that describes the relationship between your input features (X) and your output target (y).You're trying to find the parameters for this simple equation y = mx + b In your code, which is built to handle multiple features.
